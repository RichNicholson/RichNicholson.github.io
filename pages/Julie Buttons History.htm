<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Julie was a member, from the beginning of the club, for many years she was a great organiser and is still sorely missed by those who remember her. Mike Bruce</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A brief history of Julie Button at Elmbridge Road Runners</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Julie Button joined Elmbridge Road Runners circa 1984. In 1983, at the age of 35, she had been diagnosed with breast cancer and undergone a mastectomy. She observed that running looked a good way to lose weight as well as helping to keep fit but she proved to be rather competitive and her running quickly became a more serious enterprise. On 10</span><span class="s2"><sup>th</sup></span><span class="s1"> May 1987 she ran the London Marathon, achieving a time of 4:14 which included the long wait to cross the starting line.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">She went on to qualify as an athletics coach for 5K and 10K and for a while she led stretching exercises prior to Thursday evening club runs.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Although her cancer spread she enjoyed lengthy periods of remission and was able to race regularly and managed to include the Bruges Vets 10K and the 17.7K Paris to Versailles. She also served the club in other ways.  </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Ina 1990 club newsletter it was reported:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">OnThursday 9</span><span class="s2"><sup>th</sup></span><span class="s1"> November, following a widespread advertising campaign, we had an open evening for potential new lady members, aimed at beginners. This was held in the cafe at the Leisure Centre. Julie and Mary gave an informal talk with a brief description of the club and its aims and the type of running programme we had planned for them. The evening ended with coffee and biscuits and a very friendly prolonged natter. 13 ladies attended.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Then in 1991:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">PastaParty – Whether you are running the marathon, helping at the finish or just supporting your fellow club members you are invited to a Pre-London PastaParty, to be held at Julie Button’s on Friday 20</span><span class="s2"><sup>th</sup></span><span class="s1"> April. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the newsletter for August 1992:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Many moons ago many of you will recall Julie Button coming around and taking names of those of those interested in doing the London to Brighton Bike Run. Julie had to withdrawer, as many of you will know she has trouble with her hip.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And in 1992 Julie herself wrote:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">With Christmas well behind us and, hopefully, the bad weather too, we now have spring and the lighter nights to look forward to. It is good to see so many of you turning up for the Tuesday night run. Plenty of events are being organised for the summer months including the 5 mile (give or take a few hundred yards)River Handicap which proved very popular last year and the men versus ladies round the island race. To kick off the events for the summer I am organising another Relay Race to be held on Tuesday 5th May. I am also continuing the Mile Reps which are now a feature of the last Tuesday of each month</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Again in 1992:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I am organising the Relay Races once again. The distance is approx. 2/3rds of a mile, up and back Waterside Drive. As before teams will be made up of 3 runners and each person will run 3 times. Prizes will awarded in the bar afterwards for the first team and the fastest leg run by (a) a man, (b) a lady, and (c) an over 50 and of course there will be the dreaded wooden spoons.   <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Julie handled the 10K entries for a while and looks to have taken a hectoring role for the event in 1992 !<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">I do not think this is too early to remind all members that our 10K race is being held this year on 19</span><span class="s3"><sup>th</sup></span><span class="s1"> July.Please if at all possible would you mark this date in your diary NOW and leave it free. Help will be needed from all of you on the day to make this another happy and successful event. I am sure as in years past that helpers will be invited to unwind at an after race barbecue to say thank you for your help. Needless to say, any member able to help with administration before the event please let me know. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In1992 she was both Ladies Captain and Membership Secretary though she had clearly given up one of these roles later on when it was the new Ladies Captain recorded that:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">JulieButton is continuing to coach the ladies.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the September 1993 Newsletter the Chairman noted:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Pleased to see Julie back organising some of her traditional club events to improve our speed levels – you’ll be sweating now!’<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">July died on Friday 15</span><span class="s2"><sup>th</sup></span><span class="s1"> July 1994, two days before that year’s Elmbridge10K. She was 46.</span></p>
